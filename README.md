# Global-Development-Indicators

## About
A project for my Data Visualization class at University of Chicago. Here, I visualized several different measurements of socioeconomic development for countries, and allowed one to look at a given country's trajectory over time.  

One can look at the example1.jpg and example2.jpg to look at some of the basic features of the visualization. In example1, the top row of buttons signifies the different indicators to look at (which we selected from a jumbo list using PCA), the left box contains a histogram grid where color signifies more countries rather than less, and the right contains a heatmap where color encodes a higher or lesser value for the selected indicator. In example 2, an orange line is overlaid on the grid that plots a given countries trajectory over the years (on the y-axis), plotting the country's development (or lack thereof) over time. This particular example was Sudan and drinking water. 

## My role

I contributed to many aspects of this piece, but primarily with the grid and wrangling the data so it could be properly visualized. I helped debug the coloring of the map as well.

## What could be worked on

While we have a barebones app, it certainly needs some cosmetic updating as well as reduced inefficiencies in some places. The page runs fairly slowly, which should be improvable.

## Running the project

If you have yarn on your computer, you can simply execute yarn run from the scaffold folder, which will run a server to view the website.
